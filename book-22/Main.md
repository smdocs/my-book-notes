# What is life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. 

The most important question that the author raises and tries to answer is

> How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by 
physics and chemistry?

The arrangements of the atoms in the most vital parts of an organism and the interplay of these arrangements differ in a fundamental way from all those arrangements of atoms which physicists and chemists have hitherto made the object of their experimental and theoretical research.

Yet the difference which I have just termed fundamental is of such a kind that it might easily appear slight to anyone except a physicist who is thoroughly imbued with the knowledge that the laws of physics and chemistry are statistical throughout. 

#### Periodic vs Aperiodic Crystalls
 The most essential part of a living cell-the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. Periodic crystals constitute fascinating and complex material structures of inanimate natural objects, however the same pattern of molecular structure is repeated again and again to form an inaniminate object.
 
Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, periodic crystalls are rather plain and dull. The difference in structure is of the same kind as that between an ordinary wallpaper in which the same pattern is repeated again and again in regular periodicity and a masterpiece of embroidery, say a Raphael tapestry, which shows no dull repetition, but an elaborate, coherent, meaningful design traced by the great master
