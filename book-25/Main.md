#### Darwin speculated that if creatures shared a genealogical tree then the amino acids sequences of proteins of humans, other primates,mammals and frogs should reflect their evolutionary history.

- <b> What do proteins of diverse animals tell about their relationship? - Pauling and Zuckerkandl</b>
Zukerkandl demonstrated that proteins might have a lot to say about the history of humankind. He compared hemoglobin, all animals
use oxygen for their metabolism and this blood protein carries oxygen to all organs.
- <b> How closely are humans related to other primates? - Alan Wilson</b>
  Humans and chimps are related closely to each other than some differnt spieces of mouse. Humans and Chimps at the level of genes and proteins almost identical.
- <b> If at the genetic and protien level, humans and chimps are almost identical then what is driving their differences?</b>
  - Genes are rare in genomes. Only 2 percent of an entire genome consists of genes. The question is what is the other 98% of a genome composed of?
  - Jacob and Manod showed the common bacterium can digest two kind of sugars in its environment, glucose and lactose. When glocose
  is abundant and lactose is rare, its amino acids make a protien than can digest glucose and the reverse when lactose is more easily available.
  - Two components in the bacterial genome exists, in the first component the genes contains information about the structure of each protein that needs to get generated, the second component contains a sequence of bases that don't code for protein at all. These shorter strings act as <b>molecular switches</b> that can turn a gene on or off as needed. In other words when it turns it on, the gene becomes active to code a protein and when it is off, the gene does not code for protein.

  <b>Sonic Hedgehog</b>
The SHH gene provides instructions for making a protein called Sonic Hedgehog. This protein functions as a chemical signal that is essential for embryonic development. Sonic Hedgehog plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of the body. This protein is important for development of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, limbs, and many other parts of the body
