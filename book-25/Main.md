#### Darwin speculated that if creatures shared a genealogical tree then the amino acids sequences of proteins of humans, other primates,mammals and frogs should reflect their evolutionary history.

- <b> What do proteins of diverse animals tell about their relationship? - Pauling and Zuckerkandl</b>
Zukerkandl demonstrated that proteins might have a lot to say about the history of humankind. He compared hemoglobin, all animals
use oxygen for their metabolism and this blood protein carries oxygen to all organs.
- <b> How closely are humans related to other primates? - Alan Wilson</b>
  Humans and chimps are related closely to each other than some differnt spieces of mouse. Humans and Chimps at the level of genes and proteins almost identical.
- <b> If at the genetic and protien level, humans and chimps are almost identical then what is driving their differences?</b>

  <b>Sonic Hedgehog</b>
The SHH gene provides instructions for making a protein called Sonic Hedgehog. This protein functions as a chemical signal that is essential for embryonic development. Sonic Hedgehog plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of the body. This protein is important for development of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, limbs, and many other parts of the body
