#### Darwin speculated that if creatures shared a genealogical tree then the amino acids sequences of proteins of humans, other primates,mammals and frogs should reflect their evolutionary history.

Zukerkandl demonstrated that proteins might have a lot to say about the history of humankind. He compared hemoglobin, all animals
use oxygen for their metabolism and this blood protein carries oxygen to all organs.
