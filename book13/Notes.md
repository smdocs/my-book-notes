#Guesstimation 
#####by Lawrence Weinstein and John Adam

####Why Estimate?
We are continually bombarded by numbers, good, bad and bogus.
- Our deficit is $1 trillion
- Every American produces 100 cubic-feet of garbage a year

Do they make sense? How should we respond? Answers/estimates lead to actions.

Estimates fall in one of three ‘Goldilocks’ categories:
1. Too big
2. Too small
3. Just right (in the middle)

‘Too big’ or ‘Too small’ lead to obvious actions. ‘In the middle’ requires more thought (and perhaps even actual calculation).

####How to estimate (almost) anything?

#####1. Write down the answer (to within a factor of 10).
  1. Establish lower and upper bounds,
  2. Then take the geometric mean for your answer.

```
How many clowns can fit in a Cooper Mini?

More than 1 (100) and less than 100 (102).

Estimate =
This ensures that your estimate will be within a factor of 10.
```
#####2. If you can’t write down the answer, break the question
into smaller pieces and go to step 1
