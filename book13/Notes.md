#Guesstimation 
#####by Lawrence Weinstein and John Adam

#### Why Estimate?
We are continually bombarded by numbers, good, bad and bogus.
- Our deficit is $1 trillion
- Every American produces 100 cubic-feet of garbage a year

Do they make sense? How should we respond? Answers/estimates lead to actions.

Estimates fall in one of three ‘Goldilocks’ categories:
1. Too big
2. Too small
3. Just right (in the middle)

‘Too big’ or ‘Too small’ lead to obvious actions. ‘In the middle’ requires more thought (and perhaps even actual calculation).
