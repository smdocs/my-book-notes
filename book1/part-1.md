# The Development of the Universe

##### 1. Dark Matter
 - Dark matter is elusive and has only miniscule interactions with ordinary matter.
 - Dark matter is composed of particles that behave differently compared to traditional particle dynamics.
 - When large amounts of dark matter aggregate its net gravitational influence on our universe, galaxies is significant. it plays
  a pivotal role in the structure of the universe.
 - Dark matter can be simply be matter that has different or no fundamental charges. Hence it does not absorb light or react with any of the known particles of today.

##### 2. Dark Energy
- Is energy that is distibuted uniformly accross the universe, it exists even when there are no particles or matter around.
- Unlike dark matter, dark energy is does not clump and can be no denser in one region than another. Dark matter though collects into objects
- Dark energy remains constant over time and can referred as a <b>cosmological constant</b>.
- One big mystrey about dark energy is its existance and nobody knows why? although quantum mechanics and gravity predicts its existence.

Dark matter might account for some peculiarities of our Solar systems and may even have had a part to play in the development of life on Earth.

### The Discovery of Dark Matter

##### Gravitational Lensing
Gravitational lensing works in an analogous way and is an effect of Einstein's theory of general relativity – simply put, mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object (and thus through its gravitational field) to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and hence the greater the bending of light rays - just like using denser materials to make optical lenses results in a greater amount of refraction.

Gravitational lensing is used in many ways

 1. Find a distant object which cannot see otherwise.
 2. Calculate the mass of objects, galaxy clusters.
