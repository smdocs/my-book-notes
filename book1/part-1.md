# The Development of the Universe

### 1. Dark Matter
 - Dark matter is elusive and has only miniscule interactions with ordinary matter.
 - Dark matter is composed of particles that behave differently compared to traditional particle dynamics.
 - When large amounts of dark matter aggregate its net gravitational influence on our universe, galaxies is significant. it plays
  a pivotal role in the structure of the universe.
 - Dark matter can be simply be matter that has different or no fundamental charges. Hence it does not absorb light or react with any of the known particles of today.

### 2. Dark Energy
- Is energy that is distibuted uniformly accross the universe, it exists even when there are no particles or matter around.
- Unlike dark matter, dark energy is does not clump and can be no denser in one region than another. Dark matter though collects into objects
- Dark energy remains constant over time and can referred as a <b>cosmological constant</b>.
- One big mystrey about dark energy is its existance and nobody knows why? although quantum mechanics and gravity predicts its existence.
