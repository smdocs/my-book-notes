# Development of the Universe

###The Clandestine Dark Matter Society

##### 1. Dark Matter
 - Dark matter is elusive and has only miniscule interactions with ordinary matter.
 - Dark matter is composed of particles that behave differently compared to traditional particle dynamics.
 - When large amounts of dark matter aggregate its net gravitational influence on our universe, galaxies is significant. it plays
  a pivotal role in the structure of the universe.
 - Dark matter can be simply be matter that has different or no fundamental charges. Hence it does not absorb light or react with any of the known particles of today.
 - Dark matter might account for some peculiarities of our Solar systems and may even have had a part to play in the development of life on Earth.


##### 2. Dark Energy
- Is energy that is distributed uniformly across the universe, it exists even when there are no particles or matter around.
- Unlike dark matter, dark energy is does not clump and can be no denser in one region than another.
- Dark energy remains constant over time and can referred as a <b>cosmological constant</b>.
- One big mystery about dark energy is its existence and nobody knows why?  Although quantum mechanics and gravity predicts its existence.

### The Discovery of Dark Matter

##### Gravitational Lensing
Gravitational lensing works in an analogous way and is an effect of Einstein's theory of general relativity â€“ simply put, mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object (and thus through its gravitational field) to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and hence the greater the bending of light rays - just like using denser materials to make optical lenses results in a greater amount of refraction.

Gravitational lensing is used in many ways

 1. Find a distant object which cannot see otherwise.
 2. Calculate the mass of objects, galaxy clusters.
 
### The Big Questions

 2. Why is there something rather than nothing? 
   Lisa answers this question by justifying our existence and also stating something is more special that nothing. Also one needs the physical laws to explain a very nonrandom occurrence; therefore a cause implies that there must be something.

3. Why is there so much energy in ordinary matter and how did it exist so long?

### Almost The Very Beginning

What do we know about the Big Bang Theory?

1. We don't know how the universe started but we do know a lot more about its behaviour after 10-36 seconds from its inception.
2. The lynchpin of the theory is the Universe's expansion. It is that space is expanding meaning that the distance between two objects like galaxies is expanding over time.

3. Einstien derived the expansion of the universe from his equations of relativity and introduction a new energy that could thwart the predicted expansion.
4. In 1929 Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was indeed expanding and that the introduction of the new form of energy by Einstien was indeed real. Later on this was known as <b>dark energy</b>.
5. Hubble's constant is the rate at which the universe currently expands which is 72 km/sec/Mpc (meaning something at the distance of a megaparsec moves away at 72km/sec)
