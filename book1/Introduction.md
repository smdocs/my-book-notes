# Introduction
Lisa starts with subtle correlation between the cause of the extinction of the Dinosaurs, 66 million years ago and "Dark Matter". 

Although dinosaurs and Dark Matter may at first glance look completely unrelated but when one considers the universe to be a single entity and in principle its components interact, a link between the two can be established.

> No one knows why an object (possibly a comet) 10 Kms wide plummeted into the earth from its stable orbit to end the reign of the dinosaurs and three-quarters of other species in the planet. 

Lisa speculates that during the Solar systems passage through the mid plane Milky Way, it encountered a disk of <b>dark matter</b> that dislodged the distant object.

In this book, Lisa tries to connect the deep interactions between the Universe, the Milky Way, the Solar system that got us where we are and the context in which it developed. It builds upon the following lessons learnt;

1. At the most fundamental level, the physics of elementary particles, the physics of the cosmos and the biology of life itself all connect in remarkable ways that requires more understanding.
2. The second point re-iterates how recent scientific developments (within the last 50 years) have revolutionized our understanding of these fundamental cosmic connections.
3. The third major lesson centers on the rate of change. Natural selection works well when species have time to adapt and evolve but is not suited for radical changes or catastrophic events such as the object that hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs.
4. The fourth lesson is the remarkable science describing the often hidden elements in our world both biological and physical.

The book covers the following topics in sections

1. Dark Matter constitutes 85 percent of the matter in the universe, yet we are pre-occupied the relevance of ordinary visible matter which to be fair interacts far more strongly. Lisa will explain dark matter's critical role in the formation of the universe.
2. Life's formation as well as its destruction and covers the five major mass extinctions including that of the dinosaurs.
3. The final section integrates ideas from the first two and builds models of dark matter and how and what it affects.

At this point, we only know that dark matter and ordinary matter interact via gravity. But what if dark matter experiences non-gravitational interactions too? if true, dark matter could lead to dramatic evidence of connections between elementary matter and macroscopic phenomena.
