# Book 1 - Lisa Randall

# Introduction
Lisa starts with subtle corelation between the cause of the extinction of the Dinosaurs, 66 million years ago and "Dark Matter". 

Although dinosaurs and Dark Matter may at first glance look completely unrelated but when one considers the universe to be a single entity
and in principle its components interact a link between the two can be established.

> No one knows why an object (possibly a comet) 10 Kms wide plummted into the earth from its stable orbit to end the reign of the dinosaurs and three-qurters of
other species in the planet. 

Lisa speculates that during the Solar systems passage through the mid plane Milky Way, it encountered a disk of <b>dark matter</b> that dislodged the distant object.

In this book, Lisa tries to connect the deep interactions between the Universe, the Milky Way, the Solar system that got us where we are and the context in which it developed.
