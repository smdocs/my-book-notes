#Part 1 - Staffing a Scalable Organization

> Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one; it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.—Sun Tzu

####1.1 The Impact of People and Leadership on Scalability
> Providing role clarity is the responsibility of leaders and managers.

  - People are the most important piece of the scale puzzle.
  - The right person in the right job at the right time and with the right behaviors is essential to scale organizations, 
    processes, and systems.
  - Organizational structures are rarely “right or wrong.” Any structure is likely to have pros and cons relative to your 
    needs.
  - When designing your organization, consider the following points: 
    - The ease with which additional units of work can be added to the organization. 
    - How easily can you add or remove people to/from this organization? 
    - Do you need to add them in groups, or can you add individual people?
    
####1.2 Roles for the Scalable Organization

A Tool for defining responsibilities, the tool we use most often is called RASCI. It is a responsibility assignment chart, and the acronym stands for Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted, and Informed.

- R: Responsible. This is the person responsible for completing the project or initiative.
- A: Accountable. This is the person to whom R is accountable and who must approve the work before it is okay to complete. When using RASCI as a decision-making tool, the A is sometimes referred to as the approver of any key decision.
- S: Supportive. These people provide resources to complete the project or initiative.
- C: Consulted. These people have data or information that can be useful in completing the project.
- I: Informed. These people should be notified, but do not need to be consulted or provide input to the project.    

RASCI can be used in a matrix, where each activity or initiative is spelled out along the y-axis (vertical axis) of the matrix and the individual contributors or organizations are spelled out on the x-axis of the matrix. The intersection of the activity (y-axis) and the organization (x-axis) contains one of the letters R, A, S, C, or I, but may include nothing if that individual or organization is not part of the initiative. <b> Ideally, in any case, there will be a single R and a single A for any given initiative.</b> This elimibates the possiblity of multiple individuals acquiring responsiblities for the same initiative.

- Role clarity is critical for scale initiatives to be successful.
- Overlapping responsibility creates wasted effort and value-destroying conflicts.
- Areas lacking responsibility create vacuums of activity and failed scale initiatives.
- The CEO is the chief scalability officer of the company.
- The CTO/CIO is the chief technical scale officer of the company.
- RASCI is a tool that can help eliminate overlaps in responsibility and create clear role definition.
