#Part 1 - Staffing a Scalable Organization

> Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one; it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.—Sun Tzu

#### <a name="part1-1">1.1 The Impact of People and Leadership on Scalability
> Providing role clarity is the responsibility of leaders and managers.

  - People are the most important piece of the scale puzzle.
  - The right person in the right job at the right time and with the right behaviors is essential to scale organizations, 
    processes, and systems.
  - Organizational structures are rarely “right or wrong.” Any structure is likely to have pros and cons relative to your 
    needs.
  - When designing your organization, consider the following points: 
    - The ease with which additional units of work can be added to the organization. 
    - How easily can you add or remove people to/from this organization? 
    - Do you need to add them in groups, or can you add individual people?

> Role clarity is critical for scale initiatives to be successful.

A Tool for defining responsibilities, the tool we use most often is called RASCI. It is a responsibility assignment chart, and the acronym stands for Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted, and Informed.

- R: Responsible. This is the person responsible for completing the project or initiative.
- A: Accountable. This is the person to whom R is accountable and who must approve the work before it is okay to complete. When using RASCI as a decision-making tool, the A is sometimes referred to as the approver of any key decision.
- S: Supportive. These people provide resources to complete the project or initiative.
- C: Consulted. These people have data or information that can be useful in completing the project.
- I: Informed. These people should be notified, but do not need to be consulted or provide input to the project.    

RASCI can be used in a matrix, where each activity or initiative is spelled out along the y-axis (vertical axis) of the matrix and the individual contributors or organizations are spelled out on the x-axis of the matrix. The intersection of the activity (y-axis) and the organization (x-axis) contains one of the letters R, A, S, C, or I, but may include nothing if that individual or organization is not part of the initiative. <b> Ideally, in any case, there will be a single R and a single A for any given initiative.</b> This elimibates the possiblity of multiple individuals acquiring responsiblities for the same initiative.

- Role clarity is critical for scale initiatives to be successful.
- Overlapping responsibility creates wasted effort and value-destroying conflicts.
- Areas lacking responsibility create vacuums of activity and failed scale initiatives.
- The CEO is the chief scalability officer of the company.
- The CTO/CIO is the chief technical scale officer of the company.
- RASCI is a tool that can help eliminate overlaps in responsibility and create clear role definition.

> Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization. -- Sun Tze

#####Optimal team size checklist:
1. Determine the experience level of your managers.
2. Calculate each engineer’s tenure at the company.
3. Look up or ask each engineer how long he or she has been in the industry.
4. Estimate the total effort for managerial responsibilities.
  - Survey your managers to determine how much time they spend on tasks.
  - Make a list of the core managerial responsibilities that you expect managers to accomplish.
5. Look for signs of disgruntled business partners and managers who are bored to indicate teams that are too small.
6. Look for losses in productivity, poor communication, and degrading morale to indicate teams that are too large.

##### Splitting a team checklist:
1. Determine how to separate the code base:
  - a. Split by services.
  - b. Divide base classes and services as evenly as possible with only one owner.
  - c. Set up alerts in your repository to ensure everyone knows when items are being modified.
2. Determine who will be the new manager.
  - a. Consider internal versus external candidates.
  - b. Set an aggressive timeline for making the decision and stick to it.
3. Analyze your team’s interactions with other teams or departments.
  - a. Discuss the planned split with other department heads.
  - b. Coordinate your team’s split with other teams to ensure a smoother transition.
  - c. Use joint announcements for all departments to help explain all of the changes simultaneously.

- Organizational structure can either hinder or help a team’s ability to produce and support scalable applications.
- Team size and team structure are the two key attributes with regard to organizations.
- Teams that are too small do not provide enough capacity to accomplish the priorities of the business.
- Teams that are too large can cause a loss of productivity and degrade morale.
- The two traditional organizational structures are functional and matrix.
- Functional organizational structures provide benefits such as commonality of management and peers, simplicity of responsibilities, ease of task assignment, and greater adherence to standards.
- Matrix organizational structures provide benefits such as project ownership and improved cross-team communication.
- Agile Organization structures, especially those aligned to services and architecture, provide increased innovation as measured by faster time to market, higher-quality functionality, and higher availability of services.
