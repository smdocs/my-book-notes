#Part 1 - Staffing a Scalable Organization

> Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one; it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.—Sun Tzu

1.1 The Impact of People and Leadership on Scalability
  - People are the most important piece of the scale puzzle.
  - The right person in the right job at the right time and with the right behaviors is essential to scale organizations, 
    processes, and systems.
  - Organizational structures are rarely “right or wrong.” Any structure is likely to have pros and cons relative to your 
    needs.
  - When designing your organization, consider the following points: 
    - The ease with which additional units of work can be added to the organization. 
    - How easily can you add or remove people to/from this organization? 
    - Do you need to add them in groups, or can you add individual people?
