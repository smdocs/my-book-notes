#[Part 1 - Staffing a Scalable Organization](contents.md)

> Fighting with a large army under your command is no wise different from fighting with a small one; it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.—Sun Tzu

#### <a name="part1-1">1.1 The Impact of People and Leadership on Scalability
> Providing role clarity is the responsibility of leaders and managers.

  - People are the most important piece of the scale puzzle.
  - The right person in the right job at the right time and with the right behaviors is essential to scale organizations, 
    processes, and systems.
  - Organizational structures are rarely “right or wrong.” Any structure is likely to have pros and cons relative to your 
    needs.
  - When designing your organization, consider the following points: 
    - The ease with which additional units of work can be added to the organization. 
    - How easily can you add or remove people to/from this organization? 
    - Do you need to add them in groups, or can you add individual people?
    
####<a name="part1-2">1.2 Roles for the Scalable Organization
> Role clarity is critical for scale initiatives to be successful.

A Tool for defining responsibilities, the tool we use most often is called RASCI. It is a responsibility assignment chart, and the acronym stands for Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted, and Informed.

- R: Responsible. This is the person responsible for completing the project or initiative.
- A: Accountable. This is the person to whom R is accountable and who must approve the work before it is okay to complete. When using RASCI as a decision-making tool, the A is sometimes referred to as the approver of any key decision.
- S: Supportive. These people provide resources to complete the project or initiative.
- C: Consulted. These people have data or information that can be useful in completing the project.
- I: Informed. These people should be notified, but do not need to be consulted or provide input to the project.    

RASCI can be used in a matrix, where each activity or initiative is spelled out along the y-axis (vertical axis) of the matrix and the individual contributors or organizations are spelled out on the x-axis of the matrix. The intersection of the activity (y-axis) and the organization (x-axis) contains one of the letters R, A, S, C, or I, but may include nothing if that individual or organization is not part of the initiative. <b> Ideally, in any case, there will be a single R and a single A for any given initiative.</b> This elimibates the possiblity of multiple individuals acquiring responsiblities for the same initiative.

- Role clarity is critical for scale initiatives to be successful.
- Overlapping responsibility creates wasted effort and value-destroying conflicts.
- Areas lacking responsibility create vacuums of activity and failed scale initiatives.
- The CEO is the chief scalability officer of the company.
- The CTO/CIO is the chief technical scale officer of the company.
- RASCI is a tool that can help eliminate overlaps in responsibility and create clear role definition.

> Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization. -- Sun Tze

#####Optimal team size checklist:
1. Determine the experience level of your managers.
2. Calculate each engineer’s tenure at the company.
3. Look up or ask each engineer how long he or she has been in the industry.
4. Estimate the total effort for managerial responsibilities.
  - Survey your managers to determine how much time they spend on tasks.
  - Make a list of the core managerial responsibilities that you expect managers to accomplish.
5. Look for signs of disgruntled business partners and managers who are bored to indicate teams that are too small.
6. Look for losses in productivity, poor communication, and degrading morale to indicate teams that are too large.

##### Splitting a team checklist:
1. Determine how to separate the code base:
  - a. Split by services.
  - b. Divide base classes and services as evenly as possible with only one owner.
  - c. Set up alerts in your repository to ensure everyone knows when items are being modified.
2. Determine who will be the new manager.
  - a. Consider internal versus external candidates.
  - b. Set an aggressive timeline for making the decision and stick to it.
3. Analyze your team’s interactions with other teams or departments.
  - a. Discuss the planned split with other department heads.
  - b. Coordinate your team’s split with other teams to ensure a smoother transition.
  - c. Use joint announcements for all departments to help explain all of the changes simultaneously.

- Organizational structure can either hinder or help a team’s ability to produce and support scalable applications.
- Team size and team structure are the two key attributes with regard to organizations.
- Teams that are too small do not provide enough capacity to accomplish the priorities of the business.
- Teams that are too large can cause a loss of productivity and degrade morale.
- The two traditional organizational structures are functional and matrix.
- Functional organizational structures provide benefits such as commonality of management and peers, simplicity of responsibilities, ease of task assignment, and greater adherence to standards.
- Matrix organizational structures provide benefits such as project ownership and improved cross-team communication.
- Agile Organization structures, especially those aligned to services and architecture, provide increased innovation as measured by faster time to market, higher-quality functionality, and higher availability of services.

####<a name="part1-4">1.4 Leadership 101
> A leader, leads by example not by force

- Leadership can defined as influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective.
- A leader's vision that inspires an organization “pulls” that organization toward the goal or objective
- Conceptually, leadership can be thought as a function with parameters. When provided input values, the leadership function returns a score that’s indicative of a person’s ability to effect change and influence behaviors. 
- The point of describing leadership as an equation is to drive home the message that although you may not be able to change some things, you can definitely work on many other things to become a better leader.
- Some parameters of leadership have to do with what you can create through either innovation or perseverance while other parameters of leadership relate to how you are perceived by others.

- Characteristics of a Leader
  - Leading from the front.” Act and behave ethically and do not take advantage of your position of authority. Behave exactly as you expect your organization to behave.
  - Checking Your Ego at the Door
  - Mission First, People Always - great leaders and managers do so by creating a culture and environment in which people feel appreciated and respected and wherein performance-related feedback is honest and timely.
  - Making Timely, Sound, and Morally Correct Decisions - What you allow, you teach, and what you teach becomes your standard.
  - Empowering Teams and Scalability - Empowerment is the distribution of certain actions, accountability, and ownership. The leadership aspects of empowerment come from the boost that individuals, teams, leaders, and managers get out of the feeling and associated pride of ownership.
    - When delegating and empowering teams, one should be clear as to what the team is empowered to do. The trick is to give the team or individual enough room to maneuver, learn, and create value, while still providing a safety net and opportunities to learn.

 - Leadership is influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective.
 - Leaders, whether born or made, can get better; in fact, the pursuit of getting better should be a lifelong goal.
 - Leadership can be viewed as a function consisting of personal characteristics, skills, experiences, actions, and approaches. Increasing any aspect increases your leadership “quotient.”
 - The first step in getting better as a leader is to know where you stand. To do so, get a 360-degree review from your employees, your peers, and your manager.
 - Lead as you would have people follow—abide by the culture you wish to create.
 - There is no place for ego when leading teams—so check your ego at the door.
 - Leadership should be a selfless endeavor.
 - Mission First, People Always. Get the job done on time, but ensure you are doing it while taking care of your people.
 - Always be morally straight. What you allow, you teach, and what you teach becomes your standard.
 - Align everything you do with shareholder value. Don’t do things that don’t create shareholder value.
 - Transformational leaders focus on the team overall, not on individuals. Don’t engage in leadership transactions with individuals (quid pro quo), but rather focus the team on collaboration and team outcomes.
 - Vision is a vivid description of an ideal future. It includes the following components: Vivid description of an ideal future Important to shareholder value creation Measurable Inspirational Incorporate elements of your beliefs Mostly static, but modifiable as the need presents itself Easily remembered
 - Mission is the general path or actions that will get you to your vision. It includes the following components: Descriptive of the present state and actions A sense of purpose Measurable General direction or path toward the vision
 - Goals are the guideposts to your vision and are consistent with the path of your mission. 
 - SMART goals are Specific Measurable Attainable (but aggressive) Realistic Timely (or contain a component of time)
    - The causal roadmap to success will help you frame your vision, mission, and goals, and will help employees understand how they contribute to those goals and aid in the creation of shareholder value.

> Management is the judicious and ethical use of means to accomplish an end.

- Management is the judicious and ethical use of means to accomplish an end.
- As with leadership, the pursuit of management excellence is a lifelong goal and as much a journey as it is a definition.
- Like leadership, management can be viewed as a function consisting of personal characteristics, skills, experiences, actions, and approaches. Increasing any aspect of these elements increases your management “quotient.”
- Forget about “management style” and instead learn to adapt to the needs of your team, your company, and your mission. Project and task management is critical to successful management. These activities require the ability to decompose a goal into component parts, determine the relationships among those parts, assign ownership with dates, and measure progress based on those dates.
- Spend 5% of your project management time creating detailed project plans and 95% of your time developing contingencies to those plans. Focus on achieving results in an appropriate time frame, rather than laboring to fit activities to the initial plan.
- People and organization management is broken into “seeding, feeding, and weeding.” 
  - Seeding is the hiring of people into an organization with the goal of getting better and better people. Most managers spend too little time on the interview process and don’t aim high enough. Cultural and behavioral interviewing should be included when looking to seed new employees. 
  - Feeding is the development of people within an organization. We can never spend enough time giving quality feedback to our employees. 
  - Weeding is the elimination of underperforming people within an organization. It is rarely done “soon enough,” although we should always feel obligated to give someone performance-related feedback first.
- We can’t improve what we don’t measure. Scalability measurements should include measurements of availability, response time, engineering productivity and efficiency, cost, and quality.
- Goal trees are effective for mapping organizational goals to company goals and help create a “causal roadmap to success.”
- Managers are responsible for paving the path to success. The most successful managers see themselves as critical parts of their teams working toward a common goal.
