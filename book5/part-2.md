#[Part 2 - Building Processes for Scale](contents.md)

2.1 Why Processes are crictical for Scale?
- Processes, such as application design or problem resolution, are a critical part of scaling an application.
- Processes assist in management tasks and standardization, and free employees up to focus on more creative endeavors.
- A multitude of process variations exist to choose from for almost any given process.
- Determining to implement any process at all is the first step. After that decision has been made, the next step is to identify the optimal amount of process to implement.
- Two methods for determining the optimal amount of process are 
  - (1) migrating from small to large through periodic changes or 
  - (2) letting the team decide on the right amount.
- A bad fit between a process and an organization can result in culture clashes or bureaucracy.
- To avoid problems between processes and organizations, you might let the team determine the right amount of process or, alternatively, start slowly and ramp up over time.
- Whenever a process is established, you should assign a person or team as owner of that process.
- Maintenance of processes is critical to ensure organizations do not outgrow their processes.
