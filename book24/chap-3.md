# The Dark Center - Blackholes Become Real

## The term "Blackhole"

It was not the peculiar properties of an astronomical object that inspired the term instead it was a **place**. An infamous prison, the scene of a gruesome incident
on June 20th, 1756, when the Nawab of Bengal, [Shiraj-ud-dullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siraj_ud-Daulah) captured Calcutta from the East India Company whose troops were commanded by the self proclaimed governor,
[John Holwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zephaniah_Holwell). When the troops surrendered, Shiraj locked Holwell and many other Europeans in the company's own prison cell, a tiny dark room (20ft by 13ft) with two 
tiny windows, popularly known as the "Black Hole".

[John Archibald Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler), although did not clain to originate the term, first used the term during a lecture in 1964, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He popularized the term for the astronomical physical location of no return.

## Early concepts

- In 1783, [John Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell) an English country parson, first proposed the idea of a "dark star". He thought of light as particles (like Newton) and he proposed that massive starts could gravitionally attract and slow  down light particles, just as they attract other astronomical passers-by such as comets.

- It took 150 years and Einstien's theory of general relativity to resurruct the idea of such a dark object. In 1905, Einstien postulated the theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) which concluded that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Its implications are;

  - maximum sprred at which matter and any information can travel
  - Establishes equivalence between Mass and Energy
  - It was his 1915's theory of [General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) that transformed our understanding of Mass, Gravity and Space. This bought black holes in the fold.
