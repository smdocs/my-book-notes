# The Dark Center - Blackholes Become Real

## The term "Blackhole"

It was not the peculiar properties of an astronomical object that inspired the term instead it was a **place**. An infamous prison, the scene of a gruesome incident
on June 20th, 1756, when the Nawab of Bengal, [Shiraj-ud-dullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siraj_ud-Daulah) captured Calcutta from the East India Company whose troops were commanded by the self proclaimed governor,
[John Holwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zephaniah_Holwell). When the troops surrendered, Shiraj locked Holwell and many other Europeans in the company's own prison cell, a tiny dark room (20ft by 13ft) with two 
tiny windows, popularly known as the "Black Hole".
