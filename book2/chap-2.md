# Methodology

Before defining methods for performance tuning, here are some of the key terms for systems performance 

1. **IOPS** Input/Output operations per second is a measure of the rate of data transfer operations.
2. **Throughput** the rate of work performed such as operations/sec, requests/sec or transactions/sec
3. **Response Time** the time for an operation to complete
4. **Latency** is a measure of time an operation spends waiting and time spent being serviced
5. **Utilization** is a measure of how busy a resource is, based on how much time in a given interval it was actively performing work.
