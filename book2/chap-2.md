# Methodology

Before defining methods for performance tuning, here are some of the key terms for systems performance 

1. **IOPS** Input/Output operations per second is a measure of the rate of data transfer operations.

2. **Throughput** the rate of work performed such as operations/sec, requests/sec or transactions/sec

3. **Response Time** the time for an operation to complete

4. **Latency** is a measure of time an operation spends waiting and time spent being serviced

5. **Utilization** is a measure of how busy a resource is, based on how much time in a given interval it was actively performing work.

6. **Saturation** is the degree to which a resource is queued work that it cannot service

7. **Bottleneck** a resource that limits the performance of the system.

8. **Workload** the input load applied to a systm is the workload

9. **Cache** a fast storage that can duplicate or buffer a limited amount of data in order to avoid communicating with a slower storage,
