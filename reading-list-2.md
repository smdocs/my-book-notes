About ##

In this paper, the critical knowledge needed to master programmer summarized into three categories 19 key concepts, and gives each of the key concepts required to master introductory books, reading books, and extended reading. It aims to be the best and most comprehensive programmers required reading list.

## Foreword

> Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.

> Francis Bacon

Good programmer should have two capacities:

* Good [programming] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1) capacity:
    * Master commonly used data structures and algorithms (such as linked lists, stacks, stack, queue, sorting and hashing);
    * Understand core concepts of computer science (for example, computer architecture, operating systems, compiler theory and computer networks);
    * Familiar with at least two more programming languages ​​(such as C ++, Java, C #, and Python);
* Professional [software development] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91) Literacy:
    * With good programming practice to write testable (Testable), scalable (Extensible), maintainable (Maintainable) code;
    * Grasp customer needs, delivered on time customers need software product;
    * Understanding of modern software development process of the core concepts (such as object-oriented programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery, etc.).

And other capabilities, like [programming] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1) capacity and [ software development] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91) literacy project from the experience and book knowledge. Project Experience varies (programmers from various fields, the project will have a significant difference); but book knowledge is shared - especially classic books, they are able to broaden their horizons programmers, programmers to improve the growth rate.

In the last years of study and work, I read a lot of programming / software development books. With the increase in the amount of reading, I realized:

* Classic books need to be constantly re-read - reread every time there will be a new experience;
* Books are not read, the better - most books just classic books in the extension of the concept (and sometimes copy);

Aware of these two points, I start thinking about a very [utilitarian] (http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%88%E7%9B%8A%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE % A9) question: how ** as little as possible from the book, get as much critical knowledge? **in other words:

* What are the key concepts of good programmer should have?
* Which books can help programmers to grasp these key concepts?

This is the starting point of this article - I'm trying to [programmers required reading list] (http://lucida.me/blog/developer-reading-list/) article to answer the above two questions.

## Standard

Before entering the required reading list, I first introduced a single book in the field of book selection criteria and selection criteria. Of course, you also [CLICK HERE] (# reading-list) to jump directly to a single book and start reading.

### Books Selection Criteria

1. ** ** reading: what is a must-read book it? If there is a book to learn a technology in any case can not miss, then this book is a must-read books - for example [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B001PTGR52/ref=as_li_ss_tl? ie = UTF8 & camp = 536 & tag = lucida-23 & creativeASIN = B001PTGR52 & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) in Java, [CLR via C #] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B00P8VZ8T4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag = lucida-23 & creativeASIN = B00P8VZ8T4 & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) in C #;
    * Note that I did not use the "classic" is the word, because the classic ** ** ** Computer Books and Computer Science ** often linked, but often requires a classic 10 years or even longer time for the test;
2. ** practice-oriented, rather than theoretical **: So this book does not contain a single principles of books too;
3. Getting ** - mandatory - extending **: reading books question is: 1 \ mostly not suitable for entry; 2 \ is not comprehensive enough... Considering the lack of entry-reading and reading extended reading list is not complete - so book in every single key concepts will be made an introductory book a must-read books (sometimes entry books and reading this book are the same), and a number of extended reading books constituted.

### Concept Selection criteria

** ** 1. Full: comprehensive coverage of important software development concepts;
2. General ** **: for every programmer, and specific directions domain-independent;
3. ** emphasis on basic, but not too deep **: good programmer needs ** ** good computer science foundation, but did not need to master programmer ** ** too deep computer science knowledge. In the algorithm, for example, every programmer should have sorted linked lists, stacks and queues these fundamental data structures and algorithms, the computational geometry, linear programming and network flow algorithms every programmer may not need to know the;

By these standards, I should have the key concepts programmer into program design, software development, and personal growth into three categories, each category by a number of key concepts of the composition.

## <a Name="fast-lane"> Fast Track </a>

Since opening Bo, there is often a friend at the forum, Weibo, QQ, and questions to learn what to read X technology suitable (for example:?? Java learning what to read, how to learn proper programming) So here I listed a "fast Track" - put together frequently asked questions, click on the question to go directly to the answer.

This reading list covers the key areas of software development introductory books and reading books, and I believe the vast majority of programmers to meet the needs, whether you are a beginner or advanced who can benefit from:

* [Theoretical] (# foundation) includes a computer programmer should master the basics;
* [Programming language] (# programming_language) software critical to development, I chose the [C] (# c), [C ++] (# cpp), [Java] (# java), [C #] (# csharp) , [Python] (# python), and [JavaScript] (# javascript) this six [mainstream programming language] (http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) introduced, if you want to further understanding of the programming language that can be read [programming language theory] (# programming_language_theory) in the bibliography;
* Understanding of programming languages ​​based on good programmer should understand the various [programming] (# programming_technique) skills, familiar with basic [algorithm data structure] (# algorithm_data_structure), and can be efficiently carried out [debugging] (#debugging).
* Good programming is the ability to be good programmers premise, but software development knowledge is essential: a good programmer should have a good [programming practices] (# programming_practice), know how to use [object-oriented] (# oop), [Reconstruction] (# refactoring), and [software testing] (# software_testing) to write reusable, extensible, maintainable code, and have the software [project management] (# project_management) knowledge and [professional development ] (# professional_developing) literacy;
* As we can learn from the successful experience of celebrity biographies, the programmer can also follow the footsteps of good programmers make their own detours. [Master words] (# master_saying) contains a series of master programmer / computer scientist interviews, any programmer can benefit from a lot;
* In order to create customer satisfaction software products, the programmer should master certain [Interface Design] (# interface_design) knowledge and [interaction design] (# interaction_design) knowledge (yes, the work should be handed UI and UX, but if you alone I would like to create a product)?;
* Professional programmers should themselves [career planning] (# career_development), and programmers familiar with [job interview] (# job_interview) processes to go farther and farther on a career path;
* Software development is a need to learn skills, learning [thinking] (# thinking) can effectively improve the learning ability and learning efficiency;
* Software development is an international work, in order to let more people know about your code (work), good [Writing] (# english_writing) capability is essential.

Although I as much as possible to perfect this book alone, but is limited to my personal experience, this book alone will inevitably be biased. So if you have a different opinion, or that the list of books missing some important books, please indicate in the comments and I'll update. :-)

### <a Name="programming_language"> 2 \. </a> Programming language

Programming language is an essential daily tool for programmers. We must first of its profits. I am here to give the C, C ++, Java, C #, JavaScript, Python, and these six [common programming language] (http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html ) list of books (I personally do not familiar with Objective-C and PHP, so they are not among them).

Note: I have given here is the programming language (Programming Language) books, rather than programming platform (Programming Platform) books. In Java as an example, [Effective Java] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B001PTGR52/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B001PTGR52&linkCode=as2&creative=3132) belongs to the programming language books while [Android programming Definitive Guide] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B00J4DXWDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B00J4DXWDG&linkCode=as2&creative=3132) programming platform belongs to Books .

Hemopurification forget that this bad bear C program design, [C and pointer] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B00163LU68/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B00163LU68&linkCode=as2&creative = 3132) is the best book entry C language. It is detailed and yet concise introduction to all aspects of the C language and the C standard library.

For the C language for beginners, the most difficult concepts just pointers and arrays, as well as pointing to an array of pointers and pointers to pointers. [C and pointer] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B00163LU68/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B00163LU68&linkCode=as2&creative=3132) spent a lot of space and icons to these difficult but important concepts speak clearly, which is why I recommend it as a C language primer reasons.

Although [C programming language] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B0011425T8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B0011425T8&linkCode=as2&creative=3132) twenty years ago books, but it is still C language - as well as computer science, one of the most important books, its importance lies not only with clear and concise language and C language code describes the whole picture, and that it is after the computer books - especially the programming language books set a new benchmark. So that in many computer books title page, there will be "Thank Kernighan taught me writing" such words.

#### <a Name="cpp"> C ++ </a>

[! [C ++ Programming Principles and Practice] (http://i.imgur.com/5KPyCw8.jpg)] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B003VPX6YS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp = 536 & tag = lucida-23 & creativeASIN = B003VPX6YS & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132)

As the inventor of C ++, no one can understand better than C ++ [Bjarne Stroustrup] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup). Bjarne use C ++ when Texas A & M University to teach freshmen teach programming, and thus there is a [C ++ Programming Principles and Practice] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B003VPX6YS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie= UTF8 & camp = 536 & tag = lucida-23 & creativeASIN = B003VPX6YS & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) of this book - it's oriented programming for beginners, includes both C ++ tutorial also contains a large number of program design principles. It is not only the best I've read the C ++ Primer, is the best I have ever read a programming book entry.

Most modern programming language syntax is very complicated, for beginners to learn programming in these languages ​​can lead to spend a lot of time in the programming language syntax (such as pointers, references, and type definitions) instead of programming methods (such as data abstraction and procedural abstraction) above . [Programming method] (http://book.douban.com/subject/1140942/) solves this problem - it focuses on program design method, so readers do not need to spend a lot of time on the programming language. This book also has a complete set of instructional development environment [DrScheme] (http://plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/), this environment will transform programming language based on the degree of the depth of the reader, so that readers can always focus on process design methods.

### <a Name="refactoring"> 3 \. Reconstruction </a>

[! [Reconstruction] (http://i.imgur.com/F6GCcGr.jpg)] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4262627/)

Any product code is not overnight, but in the constantly repeated modification evolved. [Reconstruction] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4262627/) is such a book explains how to improve the code - how on the basis of maintaining the code of conduct on improving the quality of the code (which is also important structure definition).

I have seen many programmers, they often claim to be reconstructed in the code, but they actually only the second step (to enhance the quality of the code), but there is no guarantee a first step (to maintain the behavior of code), so they called Reconstruction often counterproductive - destroy the existing code or introducing new bug. This is what I recommend [Reconstruction] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4262627/) to this book - it describes the characteristics of bad code (Bad smell) and ways to improve the code, but also to . a complete reconstruction process --1 \ write unit tests to keep (Preserve) program behavior; 2 \ refactor code; 3 \ assurance unit test. [Reconstruction] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4262627/) also introduced a reconstructed term (such as the package moves on the field, inline methods, and fields), so that communication between the programmer. Only by understanding these three aspects can be understood Reconstruction.

Here repeat the definition of Reconstruction - ** On the basis of maintaining the code of conduct on improving the quality of the code. ** [Reconstruction] (http://book.douban.com/subject/4262627/) focuses on the second step, how to improve the quality of the code, and [the Art of the code] (http: //www.amazon .cn / gp / product / B00KMJ2Q1U / ref = as_li_ss_tl? ie = UTF8 & camp = 536 & tag = lucida-23 & creativeASIN = B00KMJ2Q1U & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) focused on the first step, how to keep the behavior of the code.

Enhance the quality of the code is not difficult, but keep the code behavior is much harder, especially for not testing legacy code (Legacy Code) is concerned - you need to be introduced into the test, but often legacy code testability (Testability) poor , then you need to change the code testable. [Art code changes] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B00KMJ2Q1U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida-23&creativeASIN=B00KMJ2Q1U&linkCode=as2&creative=3132) contains a number of practical recommendations, with the change to the code testable (testable), so that it becomes possible to reconstruct, so that it becomes possible to improve code quality.

Many books on software testing, but few have a test book can be like [How to Break Software] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/0201796198/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag=lucida -23 & creativeASIN = 0201796198 & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) so both interesting and useful. Unlike traditional software testing book (often empty verbiage, can not be applied directly), [How to Break Software] (http://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/0201796198/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=536&tag= lucida-23 & creativeASIN = 0201796198 & linkCode = as2 & creative = 3132) very practical - it's from the programmer psychology, analyzes the software error path Bug most likely to produce the /, then ** cruel ** tests for these paths in order to ensure software quality .

I first read this book when the author shouted too "cruel" - even these tricky strange tricks can test it out. But this relentless (Relentless) test is the style of every professional programmer should have the mentality.

** Note **: If you are a test engineer, then please think twice before reading this book - because after reading it you will make around you miserable programmer, and even have the heart to strangle you: -D.
